# Employee-Tracker
Building a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Overview:
I spent way too long over thinking of how to best utilize inquirer, I kept trying to only call/use inquirer once. After realising it would be easier and nicer to make three different inquirers base on the posistion and used a .then and a function call to restart the loop. But I spent way too long trying to get my first idea to work.
